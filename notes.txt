//IMPORTANT ISSUES & NOTES
//To-Do App with React & React-Router-DOM

**To install REACT ROUTER
*In the terminal, `npm install react-router-dom

**There's a compatibility bug between react-router-dom@5.2.2 & react@18.2.0 and at least react-router-dom@5.3.3 is needed to fix a compatibility bug between RRDv5 and REACTv18. However, on RRDv6 SWITCH is replaced with ROUTES

**TO USE THE TODO APP THROUGH THE `BUILD FOLDER`
*Open VScode with the folder `build` via file explorer
*Open the file `index.html`
*Open the file with Live Server
*The App will be ready to be used with the root link

**Deleting tasks using React State Hook
*Writing this inside the function tag has worked
    const onDelete = (todo)=>{
    console.log("I am on delete of todo", todo);
    setTodos(todos.filter((e)=>{
      return e!==todo;
    }));
    }

**Add to do issue of not being able to write anything in the box after adding the fixed value
*To fix that inside input tag use `onChange={(e)=>{setTitle(e.target.value)}}`
    <input type="text" value={title} onChange={(e)=>{setTitle(e.target.value)}} id="title"/>
    <input type="text" value={desc} onChange={(e)=>{setDesc(e.target.value)}} id="desc"/>

**To deal with the issue of automatic reloading in AddToDo, add `event.preventDefault()` in the function
*The preventDefault() method cancels the event if it is cancelable, meaning that the default action that belongs to the event will not occur

**Some very useful codes to be noted
    *if(!title || !desc){
        alert("Title or Description can not be blank")
      }; [from AddToDo.js]
    
    *{props.todos.length===0? "No todos to display":
        props.todos.map((todo)=>{
          return <TodoItem todo={todo} key={todo.sno} onDelete={props.onDelete}/>
        })} [from Todos.js]
